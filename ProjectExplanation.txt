I have extensively used bootstrap framework along with html,css and javascript to build the frontend of the business.I have taken the example of plants nursery for the small business website and named it as Flaura online.I have taken the help of bootstrap components to showcase the overview of the business,the services it offers and for implementing "contact us" functionality.Bootstrap navbar is used to show various menus in the website.For showing various services the website offers, carousel component of bootstrap was used.The products and the feedbacks are displayed through the help of bootstrap cards.And,lastly, "contact us" form is built with the standard form in the bootstrap.There were mainly two reasons as to why I extensively used bootstrap.First,it provides various built in components with very good styles and colour choice that it makes building fashionable components of the website very easy.Also,it provides standary spacing and very easy syntax to write conditional statement for the placement of components of the website in different screen widths.It uses the concept of breakpoint rather than media-query which makes the life of developers vey easy and prevent them from re-inventing the wheel by helping them avoiding the use of several media queries.The website has imported the content delivery network in order to access various advanced styling and javascript code written for the proper styling and working of bootstrap components used.

Frankly speaking, I had already overcome majority of the challenges which arose while completing the website,in the first year of my college itself when I was learning bootstrap in general and making responsive websites with the help of breakpoints classes in bootstrap.So, I knew most of the things as to how to implement.Its just that I had to revisit the documentation which I have forgotten.So, I did not face any major problem.

As described earlier,I made use of bootstrap breakpoint classes and bootstrap grid system to make the website responsive for various devices and screen widths.For example, a div or a block has been given the bootstrap class as given below:

<div class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4">

This means that the component under the div will occupy 4 columns out of 12 for width exceeding large screen size and it will c=occupy the complete widthe for screen width less than large.
Also, I abstained myself from using any absolute pixel size for marking the dimension of any component.Rather,I have used relative dimensions like vh,rem,% and so on.
